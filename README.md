I'm a Amazon Delivery Driver and trying to break into Front-End Development or Web Development. I already learned some of the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learn some introductions of Cloud Computing and Project Management from Codecademy ðŸ’». As of right now, I am learning and practicing Front-End Development projects!

  <summary><h3> My Journey (as of now) ðŸš© </h3></summary>
  I started in community college back in Fall of 2021 when I first wanted to become an architect. I completed my classes as best as I could while also working a part time job and spending time with my wife. We moved in together and I grew a passion with computers and how websites function, questioning how can anyone could learn how to create these websites. I then did my research and practiced on Codecademy, making me gravitate more towards programming and how to become a web developer. The paywalls of Codecademy limited my learning so I decided to find to learn another way. I then found FreeCodeCamp and learned and develope my coding skills whenever I had the chance. Now, I deliver full time with Amazon and still have the ambition to get into Front-End Developement by learning and practicing as much as I can.
